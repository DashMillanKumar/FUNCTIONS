        "Answer:- a function is a block of code that is defined to perform a specific task, and it can be called anywhere in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "A method is a function that is associated with an object. It's a function that is defined within a class and is called on an instance of that class.\n",

        "### Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "Answer:- function arguments and parameters are related concepts that help you pass data into functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters are variables that are listed inside the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function.\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values you pass to the function when you call it.\n",

        "###Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "Answer: there are several ways to define and call a function. Below are the different methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Basic Function Definition\n",
        "You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Function definition\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return \"Hello, \" + name\n",

        "# Function call\n",
        "print(greet(\"Millan\"))  # Output: Hello, Millan\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Function with Default Parameters\n",
        "You can define default values for parameters. If the caller doesn't provide a value for that parameter, the default is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "    return \"Hello, \" + name\n",
        "\n",

        "print(greet(\"ReX\"))   # Output: Hello, ReX\n",
        "3. Function with Variable Number of Arguments (*args)\n",
        "You can define a function that accepts a variable number of arguments using *args.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(*names):\n",

        "# Hello, Millan\n",
        "# Hello, Kalpana\n",
        "# Hello, ReX\n",
        "4. Function with Keyword Arguments (**kwargs)\n",
        "You can also pass a variable number of keyword arguments using **kwargs. This allows you to pass values as key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(**people):\n",
        "    for name, greeting in people.items():\n",
        "        print(greeting + \", \" + name)\n",

        "5. Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)\n",
        "A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "7. Nested Functions (Function Inside Another Function)\n",
        "A function can be defined inside another function. This is called a nested function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Q4.What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- The purpose of the return statement in a Python function is to send a result or value back to the caller. It allows the function to provide an output after performing its operations, which can then be used or stored in a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "def add(x, y):\n",

        "### Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Iterable: An object that can be looped over (like a list, string, or tuple). It provides an iterator when you call iter() on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterator: An object that keeps track of the current position and gives you one item at a time when you call next().\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "# Iterable: A list\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create an iterator from the iterable\n",
        "iterator = iter(numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Use the iterator to get items one by one\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- A generator in Python is a special type of function that allows you to generate a sequence of values one at a time, instead of returning all values at once like a regular function. This is helpful when working with large data sets because it saves memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:-\n",
        "# generator function\n",
        "\n",
        "def count_up_to(max):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= max:\n",
        "        yield count  # Yield the current value of count\n",
        "        count += 1  # Move to the next number\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a generator object\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Get values from the generator\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n",

        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 4\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 5\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators have several advantages over regular functions when it comes to handling large data or sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Generators:\n",
        "Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators do not store all values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values one at a time when needed, which is more efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators only calculate values when they are required. This means they don’t do unnecessary work, which can improve performance.\n",
        "Convenience:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are often easier to write and more readable for iterating over data compared to creating complex loops.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Q8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- A lambda function in Python is a small, simple function that is defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of inputs but only has one line of code that gets executed, and it automatically returns a result.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:-\n",
        "The map() function in Python is used to apply a function to each item in a collection (like a list, tuple, or string). It helps you process each element in the collection without needing to write a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of map() is to apply a function to every item in an iterable (a list, for example) and return a new collection with the results.\n",
